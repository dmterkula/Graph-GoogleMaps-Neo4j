# Graph-GoogleMaps-Neo4j
This program creates a graph implementation that is used to model connects between cities and the travel distance between them. 
This project integrates the Neo4j graph database framework to store the graph, and it can be accessed and modified. 
This project is also integrated with Google Maps to obtain real time data about the travel distance between two cities.

This program can be started by starting an instance of the Neo4j graph database then running the Tester class.

This was a self-study program that was undertaken to learn some of the data structures studied by writing my own implementation.
In addition, I wanted to explore graph databases and webservices and see if I could connect the two projects.

Work that still needs to be done: integrate the project with Docker so it can run on any machine.
In addition this model could be changed from cities to individual addresses and begin to look at the “Amazon problem” where 
Amazon attempts to discover the most efficient way to deliver packages in the most efficient way. 
Packages could thus become the domain objects and I could begin to build ‘routes’ or optimal set for package deliveries.
